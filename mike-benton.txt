Stretch Questions

        - Instead of following regular page flow , it is positioned relative to the nearest parent that has a position property ( postion: relative )

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        - display: inline-block;

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        - Block > h1, div, push
        - Inline > span, strong
        - Inline-Block > possibly img , otherwise display-inline: block;

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        - content< padding < border < margin
